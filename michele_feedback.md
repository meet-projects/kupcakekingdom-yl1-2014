Michele's group project feedback
---

Your project is not fully complete as it is - you are on the right track and require a little bit of work to get the project working perfectly. What you have now is well-designed. I have a few other comments for you:

* Good job calling your main file `main.py` - it is very clear where I need to look to find the code and what file I need to run. 
* I don't understand why you have two files - `box.py` and `Box.py`. I think one might be an older version - if this is the case, you should delete old versions of files from your project so you don't get confused later. 
* Good job using `global` variables correctly to change the page number that I am looking at when I run your program. 
* I like that you re-used your cupcakes, frostings, and toppings image squares - it saves you a lot of code and work. 
* I also like how you made a separate folder for the real images that you used, so you always know where the "final" version of images are. 
* Inside your `while` loop, you create many of your `Box` variables and then draw them - a better thing to do would be to create the variables outside the `while` loop and DRAW them inside the loop.
* Good job with the `if`/`then` logic inside the `while` loop in terms of deciding which cupcake, frosting, or topping I chose. 
* Your code is very clean and well-written. Excellent job with that.
* You did not store the information for which cupcake, topping, and frosting you chose. What would be very nice is if you display all this information on the last "checkout" page when I am done. 
* In general, your project is not polished - there is no text, and I do not see the results of my clicks at the end.
